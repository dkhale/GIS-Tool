# Summary

The Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Travel Time Reliability Tool leverages data availability and probabilistic modeling techniques to overcome computational challenges and synthesize travel time distributions at the path level in generalized networks. The FHWA project Estimation of Travel Time Distributions along User-Defined Travel Paths provided for the development of this tool. The tool can help transportation agencies, transportation professionals, and individual users incorporate travel time variability and reliability as a criterion in decisionmaking and evaluation.

# Prerequisites

Platform—Microsoft® Windows™ fulfilling the minimum requirements for ArcGIS Pro 2.5 (or
later). Software—Arc GIS Pro 2.5 installed with a Python 3 Anaconda® (conda) environment, and the ArcGIS API for Python installed in the system. Follow the steps below to ensure you have the correct Anaconda environment and Python modules set up for the tool to run correctly. These instructions are based on ArcGIS Pro 2.5 and may differ slightly in other versions of ArcGIS Pro. Refer to the GIS Tool Users Guide for more details about how to use the software.
